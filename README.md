**`BSIT student (programming hobbyist)`**

  I am an Information and Technology freshman student at my local State University. I have developed scripts and apps that I find useful for myself and others. Such projects include webscrpaers, discord bots, media downloaders, and more.

   <summary> üíª My Programming Journey </summary>

> I have prior experience with programming before entering college. I started around 10th grade (year 2020) right at the start of the pandemic. I then dabbled into Discord and met a friend who develops discord bots and thought that I should also try doing that for fun. I looked into it and fell down the rabbit hole. Here and there, I develop bots that have their own niche and whatnot and this is where I discovered databases and utilized them for my bots. With my bots being set, I published them for the public to use. Some were invited to 10 or so guilds, others were not. I got bored in maintaining them and dropped everything off and quit programming as a whole after some months. After almost 2 years, I came back and looked outside the realm of Discord and did my own stuff. I developed projects that scrapes the web and such, found tools that can help me with my day to day, and more. Then I also got bored and quit after some weeks. Right at the end of high school, I thought to myself that maybe I should return and pursue programming as my career and not just a hobby. Now, I am studying Information and Technology with hopes of making this fleeting thought I had come to life. Whilst my current journey in my course is somewhat disappointing, I still have my hopes up in the upcoming years.
